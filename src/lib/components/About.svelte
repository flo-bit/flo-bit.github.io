						<p>
							I was one of the only kids in my class without a game console, but we had a computer.
							At 12, I got a coding book for Christmas and started making my own games in C and
							OpenGL. Though I never finished any of those early projects, I got hooked on
							programming.
						</p>
						<p>
							After school, I started studying computer science and became a software developer. I
							really like the web because it's so accessible â€” anyone with a device and internet can
							access your work instantly. Publishing and sharing your work is also pretty simple,
							whether it's as a website, a PWA, or a serverless function.
						</p>
						<p>
							Noawadays, I mostly build a variety of web-based projects. I am fascinated by the
							intersection of design and development. I love learning new things and am always
							seeking new challenges. If you have questions or just want to connect, feel free to <a
